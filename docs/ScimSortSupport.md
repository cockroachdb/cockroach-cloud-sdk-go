### NewScimSortSupport

`func NewScimSortSupport(supported bool, ) *ScimSortSupport`

NewScimSortSupport instantiates a new ScimSortSupport object.
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed.

### NewScimSortSupportWithDefaults

`func NewScimSortSupportWithDefaults() *ScimSortSupport`

NewScimSortSupportWithDefaults instantiates a new ScimSortSupport object.
This constructor will only assign default values to properties that have it defined,
but it doesn't guarantee that properties required by API are set.

### GetSupported

`func (o *ScimSortSupport) GetSupported() bool`

GetSupported returns the Supported field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### SetSupported

`func (o *ScimSortSupport) SetSupported(v bool)`

SetSupported sets Supported field to given value.

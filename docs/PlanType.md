# PlanType

## Enum
>  - BASIC: The Basic plan includes essential operational features, is available in select regions, and offers on-demand capacity, making it ideal for small teams with unpredictable workloads.  - STANDARD: The Standard plan includes standard enterprise security and monitoring features, is available in all supported regions, and offers provisioned pricing, making it the default choice for most CockroachDB production workloads.  - ADVANCED: The Advanced plan is ideal for workloads with stringent isolation, compliance, and security requirements such as CMEK, PCI and HIPAA-readiness, and support for dedicated hardware. Customers are advised to have their account team and/or Cockroach Labs Support <support@cockroachlabs.com> involved when provisioning Advanced clusters.

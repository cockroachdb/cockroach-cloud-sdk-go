# LogLevelType

## Enum
>  - UNSPECIFIED: The unspecified log level includes all logs.  - WARNING: The WARNING severity is used for situations which may require special handling, where normal operation is expected to resume automatically.  - ERROR: The ERROR severity is used for situations that require special handling, where normal operation could not proceed as expected. Other operations can continue mostly unaffected.  - FATAL: The FATAL severity is used for situations that require an immediate, hard server shutdown. A report is also sent to telemetry if telemetry is enabled.

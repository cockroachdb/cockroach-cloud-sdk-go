# Any

## Properties

Name | Type | Description | Notes
------------ | ------------- | ------------- | -------------
**Type** | Pointer to **string** | Identifies the type of the serialized Protobuf message with a URI reference consisting of a prefix ending in a slash and the fully-qualified type name.  Example: type.googleapis.com/google.protobuf.StringValue  This string must contain at least one &#x60;/&#x60; character, and the content after the last &#x60;/&#x60; must be the fully-qualified name of the type in canonical form, without a leading dot. Do not write a scheme on these URI references so that clients do not attempt to contact them.  The prefix is arbitrary and Protobuf implementations are expected to simply strip off everything up to and including the last &#x60;/&#x60; to identify the type. &#x60;type.googleapis.com/&#x60; is a common default prefix that some legacy implementations require. This prefix does not indicate the origin of the type, and URIs containing it are not expected to respond to any requests.  All type URL strings must be legal URI references with the additional restriction (for the text format) that the content of the reference must consist only of alphanumeric characters, percent-encoded escapes, and characters in the following set (not including the outer backticks): &#x60;/-.~_!$&amp;()*+,;&#x3D;&#x60;. Despite our allowing percent encodings, implementations should not unescape them to prevent confusion with existing parsers. For example, &#x60;type.googleapis.com%2FFoo&#x60; should be rejected.  In the original design of &#x60;Any&#x60;, the possibility of launching a type resolution service at these type URLs was considered but Protobuf never implemented one and considers contacting these URLs to be problematic and a potential security issue. Do not attempt to contact type URLs. | [optional] 

## Methods

### NewAny

`func NewAny() *Any`

NewAny instantiates a new Any object.
This constructor will assign default values to properties that have it defined,
and makes sure properties required by API are set, but the set of arguments
will change when the set of required properties is changed.

### GetType

`func (o *Any) GetType() string`

GetType returns the Type field if non-nil, zero value otherwise.

### SetType

`func (o *Any) SetType(v string)`

SetType sets Type field to given value.
